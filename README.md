Modular Recruiting Helper
Introduction
Modular Recruiting Helper is a web application designed to simplify and accelerate communication between recruiters and candidates. Instead of using cumbersome static templates, this tool allows you to create, edit, and manage small, logically complete message blocks. This makes it possible to quickly assemble personalized, natural-sounding emails for any stage of the recruiting process.

The application is fully self-contained and runs in a single HTML file. All your changes, new categories, and templates are stored locally in your browser using localStorage.

Key Features

Create your own categories to organize templates (e.g., "Client Interview").

Message Block Management:

Add new templates to any category.

Edit the title and text of existing blocks.

Delete blocks that are no longer relevant.

Effective Communication:
